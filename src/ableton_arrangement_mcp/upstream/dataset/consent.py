"""Persistent consent state for dataset recording.

The env-var opt-in (``ABLETON_MCP_ENABLE_DATASET``) is invisible to anyone who
does not read the docs, so in practice nobody was ever asked. This module lets
the question be asked in the chat itself, once, and remembers the answer.

Three states, and the distinction matters:

    UNKNOWN  — never answered. Recording is OFF; the next tool call surfaces the
               prompt so the user can opt in.
    GRANTED  — the user said yes, in their own words. Recording is ON.
    DENIED   — the user said no. Recording is OFF, permanently, and the question
               is never asked again.

Default-off for UNKNOWN makes this opt-in: nothing is recorded until the user
actively says yes — in the chat, in the client dialog, or with
``ABLETON_MCP_ENABLE_DATASET``. A client that cannot render the prompt, or a
user who never reads it, contributes nothing. Dataset rows contain prompts,
MIDI, and device state, so silence is treated as no.

``ABLETON_MCP_DISABLE_DATASET`` still overrides everything, and the env-var
opt-in works for headless/CI use where no one can answer a chat prompt.
